## Kvasa
While learning the Korean language, I always wanted to ensure that I was pronouncing Korean words correctly. So, I built a simple web app called **Kvasa**.

In Kvasa, users can type Korean words using the virtual keyboard provided on the screen and press the `Read` button to hear the correct pronunciation.
